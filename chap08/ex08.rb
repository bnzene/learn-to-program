# modern roman numerals

# Strategy: While loop, which runs as long as array contents are greater than nil. The user's input is converted to an integer and set to variable int.
# Array contains values of each numeral in ascending order. Last value in array is set to variable lastno, and use .pop to divide the number input by this value
# and return that number as variable x. Hash contains letters corresponding to each numeral (key). Use lastno to select and print the appropriate letter,
# x times. Then use -= to subtract x*lastno. End loop and repeat until it's gone through each value in the array.

# Try assigning a number to a variable, and then decrementing it by 1 each iteration; do an if/else testing for n = 5 or 3 or 1 (corresponding to 500, 50 or 5 AND int/array[n-1] > 3, which
# leads to print array[n-1] * (10 - int/array[n-1]) + array[n+1]
# could try pushing output to hash, searching it for values DCCC/DCCCC, CCCC, LXXX/LXXXX, XXXX, VIII/VIIII, IIII
# and replace each with equivalent keys CCM/CM, CD, XXC/XC, XL, IIX/IX, IV
#Â something like: output hash.push
# if output.contain?{any value in hash x} replace {value} with {key}
# then puts result
